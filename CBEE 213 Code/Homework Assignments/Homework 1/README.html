This is where I will be actually answering the assignment based on a run of my code 

        A couple limitations. The file pathing was a massive pain to figure out. It may not work for you as  
    I have a whole directory for this. If you input 0 or a negative integer/float, im pretty sure the coin 
    one just breaks. Like just straight up implodes. Please do not do that. Furthermore, I did my best to 
    add context throughout with comments, but im unsure how it will look in HTML. When i render the HTML in VS 
    it looks fine, but it breaks immediately in my browser's HTML reader. Finally, for the sake of simplicity, 
    I will upload three files. This one with all the relevant info. My script titled 'Homework 1' and my six 
    plots titled 'Plots'. If there is any issue with the submission please let me know. I spent a lot of time 
    on this. 

Question 1: 
    1:
        A: The total time across all mice is 88.46 hours. The script records the time by mouse also.
        B: The AVG_Amp data has a standard deviation that varies by mouse, but the average STD of AVG_Amp is 4.79
    
    2: 
        A: The animal with the highest average amp is mouse 'PL' 
        B: The state with the most consistent movement frequency was Non-REM Sleep at (0.88 Hz) 
    
    3: Plots will be attached - They are numbered in descending order. 1 is the top 6 is the bottom.
    
        A: I would measure which state has the most dispersed data by either looking for the highest STD 
            or by looking at which box plot(since I have those) is the widest. The most dispersed data is 
            in the 'WAKE' state. The scatterplots also support this. 
    
        B: I believe that frequency is more useful for distinguishing states than amplitude. The variance of
            amplitude across the plots is significantly greater than the variance of frequency. This makes 
            frequency more reliable and therefore better. As supported by plots 1, 2, and 3. 
    
        C: The data collected would be significantly more useful for distinguishing sleep states than mice. 
            This is because the sleep state data is much more consistent than the mouse data, in which 
            subjects AAR and PR can be seen to be wildly different, but both pairs AAL & AAR and PL & PR
            are relatively similar. As supported by graphs 4 and 5. 

Question 2:

These answers are based on one particular iteration I ran. It can do as many as you tell it. Within reason.

    A: 
        The mean is 0.52
        The Standard Deviation is 0.15
        The range is 0.5
        The median is 0.5
    B:
        Done
    C: 
        Done
