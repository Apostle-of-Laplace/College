As process engineers we might want to predict how often we will get a bottle with less than 11.75 oz of juice.  \n",

The reason is that we don't know the exact value of the fill that is too low, so we want to know the probability of getting any value that is less than 11.75.  If we have run the process for a long time and have a good estimate for the population mean and standard deviation, then we can convert our target value to a $z$ value with the following formula.\n",

If your're feeling particularly rowdy you can pull the samples from the penguin data set that we used last week.  We know how to get a random sample!  Otherwise just do the calculation using `np.random.randn()`.  It is important that you be able to do this for a single sample, outside the loop.  This is one of the most common analytical processes that you will encounter in engineering."
