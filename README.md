This repository contains code I make for my classes. If there is a class we have together, it should have the matching 
tag and numbers (e.g. CBEE 213). When downloading a program I have written, always download the entire parent folder. 
Many programs depend on other elements that are within their parent folders and will not function without them. 

When you open one of the folders it should have a README. The README file will explain the script, as well as common 
issues that will occur when attempting to use it. It will also be divided into different headers to make navigation 
easier. Always read the README file before downloading the script, as well as when you encounter issues during its use. 

I do all of my programming in Visual Studio. If you use an IDE other than Visual Studio, the script might format strangely.
For the best experience, I recommend switching your IDE of choice to VS. It can host Jupyter format locally, as well as other
programming languages, and can directly download code from GitHub (That's here). 

Disclaimer: This repository is only to help other students learn how coding works, it is not meant to assist anyone in
cheating or otherwise circumventing the learning process in any way.
