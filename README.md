Within the CBEE 213 Folder, each assignment will come with its own folder called a 'Directory'
If there is a 'README' file in the directory you are looking at ("Homework 1") for example, please read the README
If not, assume you should download the entire directory's contents.

I use Visual Studio for my IDE, if you use a different one, please note that filepath dependencies might become unreliable.
Additionally I will try to add a 'requirements' file containing libraries that were used in the script going forward. 
When you go to use a script, just open your CMD promp and type pip install -r 'requirements' and the libraries should install automatically.

Please note that the requirements file name may vary slightly depending on the assignment. 

This will get updated as I work on/finish whatever code I do for classes. Right now it is the CBEE 213 process data analysis code.
As we get more homework, Studio 3/Homework 2, etc, I will continue to upload to this repository
I hope this helps
